# Cloud Infrastructure Design Project

Cloud computing allows clients to be able to gain access to efficient and flexible resources without having the overhead of dealing with implementation and server space. They can streamline their development work and focus on the more important aspects of their work.

This project aims to create a simulation of a cloud infrastructure on a Linux environment. The client can deploy a task to be executed, check the status, and retrieve the results. The server will handle the execution itself while the client can focus on other work.

__Please read the project description located at Project_Report.pdf for an in-depth discussion and summary of this design and implementation. Setup instructions are also included.__ Additional fixes will be posted below.
